Student Grades Tracker
This is one of my first SQL projects to apply what I've learnt so far. Also hoping to use this myself in the future to track my GPA.
Description: A database system that manages student information, courses, enrollments, and grades. It allows adding students and courses, recording enrollments, storing grades, and generating reports such as course averages, student transcripts, and GPA calculations. The project demonstrates database design, normalization, queries (joins, grouping, aggregation), and data integrity using constraints and foreign keys.
